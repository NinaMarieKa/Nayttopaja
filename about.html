  <p>I'm 27 years old. I live in Vantaa with my daughter. Before I got interested in coding I used to work in a constraction company.
    I did invoicing, marketing and I was the contact person for international partners. I have also worked as a barber, personal trainer,

  <p>Hello, I'm Jonathan and I just became 18 years old. My birthday was just few weeks ago. At the moment I'm studing in keuda Kerava which is located in finland and I like working there,
     its cool. Made couple of friends, some left but overall its cool. I haven't started working yet at any jobs but with patience, I'm able to get a job even
   as a programmer. I haven't traveled much to other countries and I am not looking forward to that. I do want to become a writer of stories for some reason
 and create a a horror/fantasy story game.</p>
